This site provides the collection of our current policies on the Humanitarian Toolbox.
In most cases, consider the guidance here as our current "default answer" to many
important questions.

If you are working on a project, and you have a different recommendation, we will 
consider that request for a single project. IF it works well in that project,
we will consdier making it the default answer on new projects. We'll also consider
adding that new policy to existing projects, in those cases where the benefits
justify the work.

The site is built using Jekyll, so that we can easily support markdown 
formatted pages. Here are some important resources to get started:

This Github guide to creating pages with the automated generator shows the basics:

If you have a procedure or a tool you'd like us to adopt, please send us a PR.
This repository, like all of the HTbox projects, is open source, and 
we welcome your thoughts.
