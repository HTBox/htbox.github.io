# Finding A Task

## TL;DR

> Look at the issues page for a project, select the Milestones tab, and select the current milestone. Those are the items for the current sprint. If this is your first time helping us, look for issues tagged with the 'JumpIn' label. When you find one you like, write a comment saying "I'll work on this". One of the team will reach out to you, and see if you have any questions.

## Long Version

We use Github issues to manage work. This could be proposed features, tasks under a feature, bugs, and suggestions. We manage the backlog by using Milestones. Every project has a current milestone, and a backlog milestone. Issues assigned to the current milestone represent priority items in the current sprint. Issues assigned to the backlog milestone have been triaged and accepted, but have not been assigned any specific milestone.

Some projects have other upcoming milestones, based on customer needs, upcoming pilots, or upcoming releases.

In addition, we label issues to provide some additional guidance. Within a milestone, we will use the 'P1', 'P2' and 'P3' labels to tag the priority of a task or feature. (P1 is the highest, P3 is the lowest.) In addition, we use the 'JumpIn' label (which is always green on our projects) to denote issues that would be suitable for someone not yet familiar with the project. The 'JumpIn' issues may not always represent simple fixes, but they do represent work that does not require a deep knowlege of the code base, or a deep knowledge of the business workflow for a project.

Other labels are project-specific and will be documented for that project.

Tag yourself in a comment saying that you're working on an issue, and we'll start the converation. 

You may notice that you can't assign yourself to work on an issue. That privilege is limited to the core team. Also, we can only assign issues to registered team members. If you enjoy working on our projects, we'll add you to the team, and we will assign tasks when you tag yourself.
