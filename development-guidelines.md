# Development Guidelines

*These guidelines are based on the experience with the allReady project. These have been very helpful for us on this project, but may not be applicable to every project. We'll update these as we onboard other projects.*

## Conventions and Patterns

### Mediatr Components - Naming Conventions

The project has adopted a CQRS pattern using the Mediatr library. We have discussed ([read discussion](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/issues/1262)) the naming for these components and agreed that we will *not* suffix them with "Async".

**Commands:**

A command message should end with "Command" and descibe the action that is intended. e.g.

- EditCampaignCommand
- DeleteTaskCommand

The handlers should match the command message name with the suffix of "Handler". e.g.

- EditCampaignCommandHandler
- DeleteTaskCommandHandler

**Queries:**

A query message should end with "Query" and describe the data it returns. e.g.

- EventSummaryQuery
- TaskDetailQuery

The handlers should match the query message name with the suffix of "Handler". e.g.

- EventSummaryQueryHandler
- TaskDetailQueryHandler

### Unit Tests - Naming Conventions

**Controller unit tests:**

A controller unit test should be named as follows:

- "Controllername" ControllerTests

So, for instance: AdminControllerTests or GlobalControllerTests

**Any other unit tests:**

Any other unit tests should be named descriptively and end in "Should".

Some examples:
- DataReaderExtensionsShould
- FormFileExtensionShould
- ApplicationUserQueryShould
